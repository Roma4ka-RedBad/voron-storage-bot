<h1>Brawl Stars Converter Bot</h1>
<h3>This project consists of two parts:
<ul>
  <li>server - data processing, information storage and results delivery</li>
  <li>client (bots) - interaction between the user and the server</li>
</ul>
</h3>
<h3>Crow and I are trying to create a universal bot to help mod developers in the Brawl Stars game.</h3>
<h4># My first attempt to create a centralized system for supporting the operation of VK/TG bots and studying the operation of TCP servers.</h4>
